# Dave's Sublime config

To use my sublime settings (configuration & packages) you have to:

1. Locate your Sublime root directory. To do this, simply use the `Browse Packages...` option from the settings menu.
2. Go to `{Sublime root}/Packages/`
3. Rename the existing directory `User` into `User-old` (or whatever you want)
4. Clone this repository into `{Sublime root}/Packages/`
5. Rename the directory `sublime-config` to `User`
6. If the configuration makes you happy, delete the renamed directory `User-old`
